Welcome to <FONT COLOR=#800080>
Market Timing and Investment Management system. </FONT>This site provides financial services to investors by helping them to achieve great profit in both bull and bear markets. Our computerized market model issues buy signals at the major market bottoms and sell signals at the major market tops. 
<P></P>

Unlike many investment services on the Internet, we won't tell you where the market is going tomorrow or the next month. It is well known that the technical analysis is much more an art than a science - presuming the art of interpretation. Ask the best ten market analysts about the market direction and you will get ten different answers.  Instead, this web site provides unbiased and inexpensive but a very effective investment method that works consistently over time regardless of the market direction. By following our infrequent (about 10 - 15 transactions per year) recommendations you will be buying at or near the major market bottoms and selling at or near the major tops. You also will be working within a framework that helps you maintaining an investing discipline (instead of following the market hypes and your emotions). <P></P>

Wall Street tells you not to time the market. The recent market crash shows the value of this advice. Large Wall Street firms always run computerized trading playing against the small retail investors. The stock market is a battlefield where you compete against others investors and institutions. For someone to win, others should loose their money. Don't be these others.  Don't enter the stock market without being properly equipped to successfuly compete.  
</FONT><P></P>

Our market timing system was developed as a result of several years of market research. The result is an effective and very profitable stock market timing system. It is based on our proprietary rules developed by analyzing the market for more than a hundred years. 
<P>

For the members of this site we maintain two generic portfolios representing major segments of the market. We run our computerized market model on a daily basis 30 minutes before the market close time and publish the results on the "members-only" web site, so our customers can follow the market signals and enter transactions before the market close. In addition to textual data, we publish the charts of the related securities where all recommended transactions graphically shown (so you can see the history of previous transactions and the current one). We also send you an email when a buy or sell signal is issued by the system. 
 <P></P>

Both portfolios that we maintain are based on the ETF (Exchange Trading Funds) securities. They represent the major segments of the market and at the same time can be traded as regular securities. They have many advantages when compared against the mutual funds. They also have a major advantage when compared against the individual stocks - diversification. You are investing in a specific industry or market segment and not in a single company. One of the most useful feature of ETF - they allow you to enter a "short" transaction even on the down-trending downtick. You can read more about the Exchange Trading Funds on the following web sites: http://www.amex.com and http://www.ishares.com.<P></P>

<B>Below is a list of two generic portfolios we maintain on a regular weekly bases:</B><BR>
</FONT>
QQQ - Tracks the NASDAQ 100 market segment.<BR>
SPY  - Tracks the S&P 500 market segment.<P>

Our computerized model have been back-tested for more than 40 years during the bull and bear markets. What is very important - the model always sells all holding before the market major crash (so you will never lose any substantial portion of your investment in the future bear markets).  The model have also been back-tested for the period between 1930-1945 years - the period of the stock market recovery from the biggest market crash - a period that is very similar to where the current market is now. We will show you how our model behaved in the 1930 - 1945 period.<P></P>

<FONT COLOR=#800000>
<B>We can also maintain custom portfolios. If you are interested in a portfolio that is based on any specific security or mutual funds (not covered in our basic service) and you agree to pay a reasonable fee for this service, we will build a computerized model for your portfolio, maintain it on a daily bases and e-mail the corresponding report whenever a new "buy" or "sell" signals are issued.<BR> 
Please read the Introduction and then review the real-life examples (by clicking the <B>Portfolio Examples</B> button).<P></P> 
We are talking about triple-digit gain for the QQQ portfolio and very respected gain for the SPY portfolios even during the most sever bear market.<P></P>
