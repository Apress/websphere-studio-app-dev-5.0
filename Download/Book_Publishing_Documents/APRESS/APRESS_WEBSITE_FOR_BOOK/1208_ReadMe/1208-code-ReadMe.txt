The downloadable file (1208-code.zip) is a compressed zip file.
It contains application examples discussed in the book.

The book documents are organized by chapters (sub-directories).

Chapters 6 and 7 share a common directory since all modules belong to the same Application project.

Chapters 10 and 11 share a common directory for the same reason.

Within each directory, you will typically find three folders:
 Source  - The source files.
 Export  - Exported application EAR files. EAR files include the source.
 Server  - Exported server projects as zip files.


NOTE. Sources can also be found within the corresponding EAR files.

Download and unzip the 1208-code.zip file. Use the file content when reading the book.
